# At least one of cafile or capath must be defined. They both 
# define methods of accessing the PEM encoded Certificate 
# Authority certificates that have signed your server certificate 
# and that you wish to trust.
# cafile defines the path to a file containing the CA certificates.
# capath defines a directory that will be searched for files
# containing the CA certificates. For capath to work correctly, the
# certificate files must have ".crt" as the file ending and you must run
# "c_rehash <path to capath>" each time you add/remove a certificate.

# This option defines the version of the TLS protocol to use for this listener.
# The default value allows v1.2, v1.1 and v1.0, if they are all supported by
# the version of openssl that the broker was compiled against. For openssl >=
# 1.0.1 the valid values are tlsv1.2 tlsv1.1 and tlsv1. For openssl < 1.0.1 the
# valid values are tlsv1.
